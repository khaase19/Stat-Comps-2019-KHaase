\Abstract{
In recent years, the amount of geographic data has increased immensely.
With new technology, the accuracy and complexity of data has also
improved. This has provoked statisticians to create techniques to best
analyze and draw conclusions from this new-found data. Earlier
techniques of spatial data were not equipped to handle the complexity
and amount of present data. This project first explores how and why we
analyze data based on geographic information. The project will then
focus on the CLARANS (Clustering Large Applications based on RANdomized
Search) algorithm, which is an extension of both the PAM (Partitioning
Around Medoids) and CLARAS (Clustering LARge Applications). Example data
will be used to demonstrate CLARA, and the project will conclude with
both an evaluation of the CLARA method and a model to predict cluster.

  \chapter*{Introduction}\label{introduction}
  \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}
  
  Spatial analysis is analyzing data based on gepgraphic information. This
  includes topological, geometric, and geographic information. For
  example, spatial data may include latitude and longtitude, zip code, or
  street address.
  
  \section{Why Analyze Spatial Data?}\label{why-analyze-spatial-data}
  
  We want to analyze spatial data because there is so much of it
  available. Analyzing spatial data can help us find dissimilarities and
  similarities amoung people, places, and locations. Spatial data can help
  our society allocate resources to areas that need them most, discover
  changes over time, and BLANK.
  
  \section{Big Picture Analyzing Spatial Data
  Algorithms}\label{big-picture-analyzing-spatial-data-algorithms}
  
  There are many algorithms out there that handle spatial data.
  
  \subsection{Classification
  vs.~Clustering}\label{classification-vs.clustering}
  
  Two categories of how to analyze spatial data include classification and
  clustering. Classification groups data items together into categories
  according to their properties. It is considered supervised
  classification because it needs a training dataset to fit the
  classification model and a test dataset to evaluate the model.
  
  Clustering is organizing a set of data items into groups so that items
  in the same group are similar to each other and different from those in
  other groups {[}Rec 1{]}. Clustering is helpful in finding patterns and
  similarities/differences between data points and groups; however it can
  be quite subjective, as we will discuss later on in the project.
  
  \chapter{How to Cluster}\label{rmd-basics}
  
  There are many factors to consider when chosing a clustering algorithm,
  such as the application of the problem (what do you want to find out
  about this data?), quality vs speed trade off (size of data plays a
  role), characteristics of the data (i.e.~numeric distance measures),
  dimensionality (typically as dimension increases the time it takes to
  run the method increases and quality of the data clusters decrease), and
  outliers (some methods are very sensitive to outliers) {[}Rec 2{]}.
  
  \section{Types of Clustering:
  Partitioning}\label{types-of-clustering-partitioning}
  
  Two of the main types of clustering are partitioning and hierarchial.
  
  Hierarchial clustering organizes data items into a hierarchy with a
  sequence of nested partions or groupings {[}Rec 1, p.~405{]}. There is
  the bottom-up approach: There is also the top-down approach:
  
  Partitioning cluster methods divide a set of data items into a number of
  non-overlapping clusters. A data item is typically assigned to a cluster
  based on a proximity or dissimilarity measure {[}Rec 2, p.~405{]}.
  Partitioning clustering algorithms classifies the data into K groups by
  satisfying both that each group has at least one data point, and that
  each data point belongs to exactly one group. {[}Rec 5, p.~18{]}.
  
  \section{\texorpdfstring{How to Create Clusters: \emph{K}-Means vs
  \emph{K}-Medoids}{How to Create Clusters: K-Means vs K-Medoids}}\label{how-to-create-clusters-k-means-vs-k-medoids}
  
  \emph{K}-means algorithm and \emph{k}-medoid algorithm are two examples
  of partitioning algorithms. They both ise iterative processes to find
  \emph{K} clusters; however, they use different ways to represent these
  clusters.
  
  \subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{K}-Means (maybe don't include
  this)}{K-Means (maybe don't include this)}}\label{k-means-maybe-dont-include-this}
  
  \emph{K}-means algorithm represents its n observations in \emph{k}
  groups, with the center of the groups being the mean/average
  observation. The goal of the algorithm is to find k centroids, one for
  each cluster. In order to do this, we must minimize an \emph{objective
  function}, which is the squared error function for \emph{k} means. The
  objective function is:
  \[O= \sum_{j=1}^k \sum_{i=1}^j ||{{X_i^{(j)}- C_j}}||^2\]
  
  Where \(|{{X_i^{(j)}- C_j}}|\) is an indicator of the distance of the
  data points from their cluster centers.
  
  The steps of the algorithm are as follows:
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Choose K points in the space to represent the centroid. This works
    best if they are chosen to be far apart from eachother.
  \item
    Assign each object to the cluster with the closest centroid.
  \item
    When all of the clusters have been made, recalculate the positions of
    the K centroids.
  \item
    Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids no longer move.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  This algorithm always terminates; however, it is sensitive both to
  outliers and to the initial randomly selected K cluster centers.
  Therefore, the algorithm should be run multiple times to reduce the
  effects from this sensitivity. {[}Rec 5, p.~18{]}.
  
  \subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{K}
  Medoids}{K Medoids}}\label{k-medoids}
  
  On the contrary, instead of taking the mean value of the objects in a
  cluster, the k-medoid method uses the most centrally located object in a
  cluster to be the cluster center {[}Rec 2{]}. This causes the method to
  be less sensitive to outliers, but also requires more time to run.

  5, p.~19 for k-medoids

  \section{\texorpdfstring{How to Choose
  \emph{K}}{How to Choose K}}\label{how-to-choose-k}
  
  Many ways to choose \emph{k}, which is why these methods are so
  subjective.
  
  I will describe two of the many ways to determine K, both of which use
  visuals to determine what value of k is appropriate for the data. The
  elbow method and silhouette method are common ways to find K when using
  the \emph{K} means and \emph{K} medoids algorithms.
  
  \subsection{Elbow Method}\label{elbow-method}
  
  To start, the elbow method looks at the total within-cluster sum of
  squares (WSS) and determines when there are enough clusters so that the
  next cluster does not improve the total WSS very much. This would be the
  appropriate \emph{K}.
  
  The steps for this algorithm are as follows:
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Compute the clustering algorithm for different values of k (i.e.~k
    from 1 to 10).
  \item
    For each k, calculate the total WSS.
  \item
    Plot the curve of the total WSSs according to the number of clusters
    (k).
  \item
    The location of the bend in the plot is generally considered an
    indicator for the appropriate number of clusters.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \subsection{Silhouette Method}\label{silhouette-method}
  
  The Silhouette Method focuses on the quality of clustering. A high
  average silhouette width indicates a good clustering (how well each
  object lies within its cluster).
  
  The steps of the Silhouette Algorithm are:
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Compute clustering algoritm for different values of k (i.e.~k from 1
    to 10).
  \item
    For each k, calculate the average silhouette of observations.
  \item
    Plot the curve of the average silhouettes according to the number of
    clusters (k).
  \item
    The location of the maximum is considered the appropriate number of
    clusters.
  \end{enumerate}

  \chapter{Spatial Clustering Methods}\label{typeset-equ}
  
  \section{PAM}\label{pam}
  
  Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) is the most common realisation of
  k-medoid clustering.
  
  It iterates through all the k cluster centers and tries to replace the
  center with one of the other objects (n-k possibilities). {[}rec 2{]}.
  For a replacement to occur, the squared error function must decrease (if
  it does not decrease, there is no replacement). The algorithm eventually
  terminates with a local optimum.
  
  The total complexity of PAM in one iteration is **formula:
  \[O(k(n-k)^2)\] (o= each non-medoid data point, \emph{k}= \# of cluster
  centers, \[(n-k)\] objects to compare to, and \[(n-k)\] operations for
  calculating E). This makes for a costly computation when n is large.
  Works best for n= 100, k=5.

  Rec 6 bibliography (Ng \& Han, 2000)
  
  \section{CLARA}\label{clara}
  
  Because PAM does not scale well to large data sets, Clustering LARge
  Applications (CLARA) was developed to deal with larger data sets.
  
  CLARA is a sampling based method, meaning a sample of the data is used
  to represent the entire data set. Medoids are chosen from this sample
  data using PAM and then ``the average dissimilarity is computed using
  the whole dataset'' (**don't know what ``average dissimilarity'' means
  or how it is calculated). If a new set of medoids gives a lower
  dissimilarity than a previous best solution, then the best solution is
  replaced with a new set of medoids {[}Rec 2, p.~7{]}.

  \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}
  
  \setcounter{chapter}{4} \setcounter{section}{0}
  
  If we don't want Conclusion to have a chapter number next to it, we can
  add the \texttt{\{.unnumbered\}} attribute. This has an unintended
  consequence of the sections being labeled as 3.6 for example though
  instead of 4.1. The \LaTeX~commands immediately following the Conclusion
  declaration get things back on track.
  
  \subsubsection{More info}\label{more-info}
  
  And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter
  title or section head \emph{shouldn't be} indented, because indents are
  to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's
  obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add
  an indent there.
