In recent years, the amount of geographic data has increased immensely. With new technology, the accuracy and complexity of data has also improved. This has provoked statisticians to create techniques to best analyze and draw conclusions from this new-found data. Earlier techniques of spatial data were not equipped to handle the complexity and amount of present data. This project first explores how and why we analyze data based on geographic information. The project will then focus on the CLARANS (Clustering Large Applications based on RANdomized Search) algorithm, which is an extension of both the PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids) and CLARAS (Clustering LARge Applications). Example data will be used to demonstrate CLARA, and the project will conclude with both an evaluation of the CLARA method and a model to predict cluster.
