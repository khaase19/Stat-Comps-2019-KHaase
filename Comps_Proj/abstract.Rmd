In recent years, the amount of geographic data has increased immensely. With new technology, the accuracy and complexity of data has also improved. This has provoked statisticians to create techniques to best analyze and draw conclusions from this new-found data. Earlier techniques of spatial data were not equipped to handle the complexity and quantity of the data. This project first explores how and why we analyze data based on geographic information. Next, I will explain some of the newer spatial data algorithms, including PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids), CLARA (Clustering LARge Applications), and CLARANS (Clustering Large Applications based on RANdomized Search). Example data will be used to demonstrate CLARA, and the project will conclude a model to predict cluster.
