In recent years, the amount of geographic data has increased immensely with new technology (i.e. GPS and surveillance cameras). Additionally, the data has improved in accuracy and increased in complexity. This has provoked statisticians to create techniques to best analyze and draw conclusions from this new-found data. Earlier techniques of spatial data were not equipped to handle the complexity and quantity of the data. This project first explores how and why we analyze data based on geographic information. Next, I will explain some examples of spatial data algorithms, including PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids), CLARA (Clustering LARge Applications), and CLARANS (Clustering Large Applications based on RANdomized Search). The purpose of this exploration is to better analyze government health data from a previous STAT 495 project. I will then: use a sample of STAT 495 project data to demonstrate the CLARA algorithm, evaluate how CLARA performed, and develop a model to best predict cluster.
