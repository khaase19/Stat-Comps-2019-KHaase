Data includes: latitude and longtitude, zip code, street address, etc. 

## Why Analyze Spatial Data?
We want to analyze spatial data because there is so much of it available. 

## Big Picture Clustering Algorithms
There are many clustering algorithms out there. 

### Classification vs. Clustering
Two categories of how to analyze spatial data include classification and clustering. Classification is BLANK
Clustering is organizing a set of data items into groups so that items in the same group are similar to each other and different from those in other groups [Rec 1]. Clustering is helpful in finding patterns and similarities/differences between data points and groups; however it can be quite subjective, as we will discuss later on in the project.
