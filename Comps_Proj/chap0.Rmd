# Introduction {.unnumbered}
As mentioned in the abstract, we have much more spatial data than we have had in the past. Spatial data analysis is analyzing data based on topological, geometric, and geographic information. Spatial data may include latitude and longtitude, zip code, or street address.  

## Why Analyze Spatial Data?
We are interested in analyzing spatial data for many reasons, one being because there is so much of it available. Investigating spatial data can help us find dissimilarities and similarities amoung objects. Spatial data can help our society allocate resources to areas that need them most, discover changes over time, and BLANK. 

## Big Picture Analyzing Spatial Data Algorithms
There are many algorithms out there that handle spatial data. 

### Classification vs. Clustering
Two categories of how to analyze spatial data include classification and clustering. Classification groups data items together into categories according to their properties. It is considered supervised classification because it needs a training dataset to fit the classification model and a test dataset to evaluate the model. 

Clustering is organizing a set of data items into groups so that items in the same group are similar to each other and different from those in other groups [Rec 1]. Clustering is helpful in finding patterns and similarities/differences between data points and groups; however it can be quite subjective, as we will discuss later on in the project.
