# Introduction {.unnumbered}
Cassidy Mahar, Silvia Sotolongo, and I, for our STAT 495 project, used mapping techniques to visualize and analyze US Government data. The data contained spatial, demographic, and health status information. The only significant relationships we were able to find were between demographic information and health status; we were unable to relate health status with any spatial information. I am interested in analyzing the data through spatial clustering, to further analyze whether the location of an observation is related to one's health status. Since clustering utilizes spatial information, it may be helpful in finding patterns in the data. 

## Why Analyze Spatial Data?
We are interested in analyzing spatial data for many reasons, one being because there is so much of it available. Spatial data analysis is analyzing data based on topological, geometric, and geographic information. Spatial data may include latitude and longitude, zip code, or street address. Investigating spatial data can help us find dissimilarities and similarities among objects. This can aid in allocating resources to areas that need them most, discovering changes over time, and categorizing new objects. 

## Analyzing Spatial Data Algorithms
Many, many algorithms exist that analyze spatial data; most algorithms are focused around clustering. To get a glimpse of the number of algorithms and strategies to analyze spatial data, Figure 1 provides some examples [@ppt].  

```{r clustering_methods, results = "asis", echo= FALSE}
label(path = "clustering_methods.png", 
      caption = "Clustering Methods", 
      label = "Clustering", type = "figure", scale= 0.5)
```

As noted, the methods are aimed around clustering, which I will further explore in the next section. 

### Clustering
Clustering organizes a set of data items into groups so that items in the same group are similar to each other and different from those in other groups [@Rec1]. Clustering is helpful in finding patterns and similarities/differences between data points and groups; however it can be quite subjective. It is up to the statistician to determine how many clusters are appropriate for the data, as well as the cut off for what is considered "similar" or "dissimilar". Additionally, the statistician must choose which clustering algorithm is best to use.
