# Introduction {.unnumbered}
Spatial analysis is analyzing data based on gepgraphic information. This includes topological, geometric, and geographic information. Additionally, spatial data includes: latitude and longtitude, zip code, street address, etc. 

## Why Analyze Spatial Data?
We want to analyze spatial data because there is so much of it available. Analyzing spatial data can help us find dissimilarities and similarities amoung people, places, and locations. Spatial data can help our society allocate resources to areas that need them most, discover changes over time, and BLANK. 

## Big Picture Analyzing Spatial Data Algorithms
There are many algorithms out there that handle spatial data. 

### Classification vs. Clustering
Two categories of how to analyze spatial data include classification and clustering. Classification is BLANK
Clustering is organizing a set of data items into groups so that items in the same group are similar to each other and different from those in other groups [Rec 1]. Clustering is helpful in finding patterns and similarities/differences between data points and groups; however it can be quite subjective, as we will discuss later on in the project.
